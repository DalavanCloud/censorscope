Hacking on Censorscope

Style Guide
-----------
* Read http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaStyleGuide
* Use underscores to separate multiple words (http_request)
* Use lowercase
* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Do not use tabs(\t) for indentation (Set up your editor to
  automagically convert tabs to spaces. If your editor can not do
  that, it's time to start using emacs.)
* Don't use the block comment format ([[-- this is crap --]]), just
  use "--"
